    module: 'Guided Project – Administer Active Directory Domain Services'
---
## Project overview

In this guided project, you go through the major steps of creating, configuring, and maintaining a domain controller. You also have the opportunity to promote a domain controller.

## Setup

To reduce resource access requirements (such as access to Windows Server or a Microsoft Azure subscription), this guided project uses a Windows 10 or Windows 11 machine to run a virtualized environment. You configure a Windows 10 or Windows 11 computer’s Hyper-V subsystem to support the two Windows Server 2022 Evaluation Edition virtual machines that you use in this project. You require the Professional or Enterprise edition of Windows 10 or Windows 11 to perform these tasks.

The computer that functions as the Hyper-V virtualization host should have at least 16 GB of RAM. You can also use an evaluation version of Windows Server with the Hyper-V role installed as the host for these virtual machines, or to configure a third-party virtualization platform to host both virtual machines. The exercises and tasks in this lab use Windows 11 when describing the Hyper-V host. The options presented here make it easy to locate large virtual machine files if you want to remove the configuration after you finish with the project.

The Setup section consists of three main tasks:

 -  Install Hyper-V
 -  Create Windows Server Domain Controller Virtual Machine
 -  Create Windows Server Domain Member Server

## Install Hyper-V

In this task, you install Hyper-V and configure a NAT switch. You configure Hyper-V to use a different set of default directories to store virtual machine files and hard disks. You can use the options presented in these instructions or choose your own location.

1.  Sign in to the Windows 11 computer with an account that has local Administrator privileges.
2.  On the Windows 11 Computer click **Start**, select **Settings** and on the Settings page select **System**.
3.  On the System page of Settings, scroll down until you locate Optional Features. Select **Optional Features**.
4.  On the Optional Features page, scroll down until you locate **More Windows Features** under Related Settings.
5.  On the Windows Feature page, select the checkbox next to Hyper-V and click **OK** as shown in the exhibit.
    
    ![Screenshot of the Optional Features page with Hyper-V selected.](./Media/optional-features.png)
    
6.  When the installation completes, on the Windows Features page, click **Restart Now**.
7.  After the computer restarts, sign in again using the same account that has local Administrative privileges.
8.  Click **Start** and search for Hyper-V Manger. Pin Hyper-V Manager to the Taskbar.
9.  Open Hyper-V Manager, right click on the local computer, and select **Hyper-V Settings**.
10. On the **Hyper-V settings** dialog box, under Server, select **Virtual Machines**. Set the location of the Virtual Machines folder to C:\\VirtualMachines.
11. Under the **Hyper-V settings** dialog box, under Server, select **Virtual Machine Hard Disks**. Set the location of the Virtual Machine Hard Disks to C:\\VirtualMachines\\VHDs.
12. Click **OK** to close the **Hyper-V Settings** dialog box.
13. Open an Administrative PowerShell prompt and run the following commands to create a NAT network.<br>`New-VMSwitch -SwitchName “NATSwitch” -SwitchType Internal`<br>`New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 10.10.10.1 -PrefixLength 24 -InterfaceAlias “vEthernet (NATSwitch)”`<br>`New-NetNat -Name “NATNetwork” –InternalIPInterfaceAddressPrefix “10.10.10.0/24”`
14. Close the Administrative command prompt.

## Create Windows Server Domain Controller Virtual Machine
